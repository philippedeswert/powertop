Description: |
    PowerTop is tool that detects which Linux programs
    and kernel tunables are resulting in the largest
    power consumption and use of battery time. By
    fixing (or closing) these applications or
    processes, you can immediately see the power
    savings in the tool. You'll also see the estimated
    time left for battery power if you are running a
    laptop.
